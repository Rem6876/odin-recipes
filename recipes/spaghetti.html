            <li><p>50g pecorino cheese</p></li>
            <li><p>50g parmesan</p></li>
            <li><p>3 large eggs</p></li>
            <li><p>350g spaghetti</p></li>
            <li><p>2 pump garlic cloves,peeled and left whole</p></li>
            <li><p>50g unsalted butter</p></li>
            <li><p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p></li>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil</p></li>
            <li><p>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.
                 Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</p></li>
            <li><p>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer,
                 covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</p></li>
            <li><p>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</p></li>
            <li><p>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.
                 Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</p></li>
            <li><p>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
                 The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</p></li>
            <li><p>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.
                 Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</p></li>
            <li><p></p>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork,
                 lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li></li>
            <li><p>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.
                 If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</p></li>
